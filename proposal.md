CSCI 5636 - Numerical Solutions to Partial Differential Equations

Last Updated: 10/31

## Software: fypi

*Write a paragraph describing what the software does and who its
primary audience is.*

From the main website:

FiPy is an object oriented, partial differential equation (PDE) solver, written in Python, 
based on a standard finite volume (FV) approach. Put simply, FiPy is another PDE solver, 
only this one is based on OOP. FiPy is also primarily aimed towards Python developers who want
to start working with PDEs.

This is a very involved project with many moving componenets. Having said that, I'm worried
that there will be many complications future complications and I won't be prepared for them.
