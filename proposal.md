## Software: The Enzo Project

*Write a paragraph describing what the software does and who its
primary audience is.*

From the main website:

"Enzo is a community-developed adaptive mesh refinement simulation code, designed for rich, multi-physics hydrodynamic astrophysical calculations."
In other words, Enzo is a fully open-source software package designed for solving astrophysics related PDEs.
